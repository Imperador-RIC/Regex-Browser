# Regex-Browser

Program for performing regex queries on web pages.

The program has 3 modes of use in total, namely CLI, INT and GUI.

CLI: Using the program through the command line by passing arguments has limited functionality and can cause problems, as the user's Shell can interpret the regex code by mistake thinking they are commands.

We recommend that you do not use this mode if!

INT: Using the program and passing the necessary data through its inputs, has the best operation among all modes, and total compatibility.

GUI: Use the program through a graphical interface with intuitive inputs and buttons for handling the program.

## Observation

The program uses Microsoft Edge as an engine for its operation, if you want to run the program, you must either install Microsoft Edge, or modify the source code so that the program uses another browser as an engine.
